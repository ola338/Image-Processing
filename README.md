# Image processing ðŸŒ†
This project aims to apply different types of image filtering using various kinds of gradients such as low pass filters, high pass filters, magnitude, gradient angle and laplacian.

The project also includes implementations of median filter, uniform filter, gradient and histogram equalization algorithm without using built-in function.


## Used Technologies 
- Language: Python 
- Libraries: Scikit-image, SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Inspiration
The application was created as a part of the university subject Technologies of Medical Imaging.
